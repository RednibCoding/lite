## Windows .reg files

When you want to add **Lite here** and/or **Open with Lite** to the right-click
context menu you can use the .reg files provided in this folder.

## How to

1. Open the .reg files with a text editor and adjust the icon- and exe path to
   the path where you have installed/copied the **lite.exe** and **lite.ico**.
   (Those paths must be absolute)

2. Now you can double click the .reg files to run them. This should add the
   entries **Lite here** and/or **Open with Lite** to the context menu.
